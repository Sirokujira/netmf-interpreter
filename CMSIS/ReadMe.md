### CMSIS - Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard
This folder is a placeholder for the CMSIS source code installation. CMSIS is available from ARM on
the [ARM web site](http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-microcontroller-software-interface-standard.php)

CMSIS comes as a ZIP file, **_the version this code base is validated and tested with is v4.3 (CMSIS-SP-00300-r4p3-00rel0.zip)_**
Extract the contents of the zip file into the same directory as this readme.md file. The build system will look for the 
CMSIS support files here.
